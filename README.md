This is a simple library beeing developed by a High-School student.
The idea is pretty simple, and consists of three steps:

  1. Creating a board for the game, and implementing all chess mechanics.
  
  2. Try to create a simple AI to play against.
  
  3. Make the AI learn by playing against itself. Make it a neural network tha works as AlphaGo Zero
